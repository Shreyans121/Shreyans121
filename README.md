# Hi there, Welcome to my profile 👋 

😄 My name is Shreyans and I'm currently a JUNIOR at Netaji Subhas University of Technology pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering. 

🔭 I am passionate about building excellent software that improves the lives of those around me. I'm also a web developer focused on front end development and design. Beside that, I love Graphic designing and animating stuff.

🌱 When I'm not coding or pushing pixels, you will find me enjoying football, music or writing.

⚡ I am 1/3 of Bleeding Edge, A blog dedicated to Science and Technology where I post around 2-3 articles every week.

👯 I’m always ready to explore and collaborate. Ping me!!
